#TODO: Make sure no time series factor is impactful

# I will kind of have two different datasets, for the different tasks

#Regression tasks: Overall tier/LP?
#Classification Tasks: Game to game victory, final tier placement

# lets start with the binary task of game to game victory.

#Exploratory Analysis

    # How many nested columns are there?

    # which ones seem interesting? check correlation

    #which ones are too obvious, and have to do with data leak?

    #which ones are most likely associated with early game decisions?
